## Work In Progress

Here’s a list of all projects I work on.

### ``leaf``

**leaf** is a portfolio generator that aims to be really simple to use. My own porfolio is written
thanks that tool! It lets you to write your portfolio in **Markdown**, so it’s really comfortable to
use. You can find all directions to get starting on the [Github page](https://github.com/skypers/leaf/).

For ones who’d like to contribute, you can push *pull requests* on the github page.

### ``phraskell``

**phraskell** is a fractal viewer. For now, it only supports **Mandelbrot set**, but is planned to support
more and more fractal types. It aims to be user-friendly, and includes these features:

* fractal colorschemes
* different kinds of fractal representations (standard, buddhabrot, etc.)
* zoom with a zoom-window in order to see what you zoomin
* specify the fractal progression at runtime
* change the colors at runtime
* screenshot
* and others!

### To plan

Since ``leaf`` and ``phraskell`` are quite stable, I’m about to start a new project, bigger, linked to my
OpenGL skills…
