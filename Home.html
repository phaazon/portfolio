<p>Welcome on my online portfolio. You can find here a lot of information about me, all projects I’m currently working on or contributing to, all available programs I wrote and some ways to contact me.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me…</h2>
<p>I’m Dimitri Sabadie, I’m 21 years old. I was born in the South-West of France, in the neighborhood of <em>Bordeaux</em>. You can find me on the net as <strong>skypers</strong> or simply <strong>skp</strong>. For now, I’m used to training in a company three days a week, then going to an engineer school (EFREI) twice a week. Before that, I got a « DUT informatique », in the university <strong>Bordeaux 1</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve written programs for a very long time. I discovered the <strong>C language</strong> when I was 12, and started a long trek in the IT jungle. I quickly started getting more and more interested in <em>C++</em> then I wrote a few applications in that language, like an <strong>.OBJ mesh file loader</strong> (shamefuly called <em>lobj</em>) with light and camera support in <em>OpenGL</em>. A few days after lobj was released, I got my first way into the IRC world. I met a french OpenGL channel where I was adviced to transform <em>lobj</em> into a realtime 3D engine. I really enjoyed my experiments with the engines I wrote. The first one was called <strong>SGLE</strong> for <strong>S</strong>kypers <strong>O</strong>pen<strong>GL</strong> <strong>E</strong>ngine, then I refactored it again and again, and finally, I ended up in the demoscene world where I met nice people. It was also the time where I discovered the <strong>D language</strong>, a very nice language.</p>
<p>Today, I write programs in Haskell, and you can find all the things I want you to see – and guess you’ll like – in the <a href="Available.html">Available</a> part of that website.</p></div><footer id="wrapper_footer"><p id="wrapper_footer_copyright">(C) Dimitri skypers Sabadie, (2013)</p><p id="wrapper_footer_generator">Generated by <code>leaf</code></p></footer></body></html>
